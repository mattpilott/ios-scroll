		'Alex: Hey Jamie! 14 weeks today! How are you feeling?',
		'Jamie: Hey Alex! Same here. Honestly, feeling a little more human again!',
		'Alex: Right? That first trimester fatigue was brutal.',
		'Jamie: I basically lived on crackers and naps.',
		'Alex: Same! Have you started showing yet?',
		'Jamie: A tiny bit! Just a little bump. You?',
		'Alex: Yeah, barely noticeable unless I wear tight clothes.',
		'Jamie: Are your jeans still fitting?',
		'Alex: Barely. I just ordered one of those belly bands.',
		'Jamie: Ooh, I need to get one of those!',
		'Alex: Any weird cravings kicking in?',
		"Jamie: Yes! Pickles and peanut butter. It's so bizarre.",
		"Alex: Hahaha I've been obsessed with watermelon lately.",
		'Jamie: That sounds refreshing actually.',
		'Alex: Did you go for your scan last week?',
		'Jamie: Yep! Baby was wiggling all over the place.',
		'Alex: Aw, same here. It felt so surreal to see the little arms and legs!',
		'Jamie: I cried a bit, not gonna lie.',
		"Alex: Totally valid. It's such an emotional experience.",
		'Jamie: Have you told work yet?',
		'Alex: Just did this week. They were really supportive.',
		"Jamie: That's great. I told my manager yesterday too.",
		'Alex: Starting to think about maternity clothes already?',
		'Jamie: Definitely browsing. Maternity leggings are calling my name.',
		"Alex: I swear I'm living in stretchy clothes already.",
		'Jamie: Same. Comfort is queen right now.',
		'Alex: Are you sleeping any better lately?',
		'Jamie: A bit. Still waking up to pee constantly though.',
		'Alex: The 2am bathroom visits are relentless!',
		"Jamie: And don't get me started on the dreams. So vivid!",
		'Alex: Omg yes, I dreamt I gave birth to a puppy last night.',
		'Jamie: ðŸ˜‚ I dreamed I was on a spaceship giving birth. What is pregnancy?!',
		'Alex: Seriously! Our brains are on another level right now.',
		'Jamie: Are you doing any pregnancy yoga or anything?',
		'Alex: I started some gentle stretches. It helps with the backache.',
		'Jamie: I should try that. My lower back is killing me already.',
		'Alex: I also started journalingâ€”just to track this wild journey.',
		"Jamie: That's such a nice idea. I might steal that.",
		"Alex: Please do! It's kind of therapeutic.",
		'Jamie: Any names on your list yet?',
		"Alex: We've got a few. Nothing settled. You?",
		'Jamie: Same. I keep changing my mind daily.',
		'Alex: I feel like names will feel more real after we find out the gender.',
		'Jamie: Yep. Are you finding out?',
		'Alex: Yeah, we want to. Mid-May I think. You?',
		'Jamie: Same. I just want to connect more with them, you know?',
		'Alex: Totally get that.',
		'Jamie: Any weird symptoms lately?',
		'Alex: Nosebleeds. Out of nowhere!',
		"Jamie: I've been super congested. Pregnancy rhinitis, apparently.",
		'Alex: Never knew that was a thing before this.',
		'Jamie: Pregnancy is wild. Every day is a new surprise.',
		'Alex: Have you started looking at baby stuff yet?',
		"Jamie: I'm trying not to go overboard, but YES.",
		"Alex: It's hard not to. So many cute onesies!",
		'Jamie: And the tiny socks ðŸ˜­',
		"Alex: My heart can't handle the cuteness.",
		'Jamie: Have you joined any pregnancy forums?',
		'Alex: A couple, but they can be overwhelming sometimes.',
		'Jamie: I get that. I like chatting with someone going through it at the same time.',
		"Alex: Same! It's comforting.",
		"Jamie: How's your partner been through all this?",
		"Alex: Super supportive, but I think it's just hitting him that this is real.",
		'Jamie: Mine too. He keeps talking to the bump already.',
		"Alex: Aw that's adorable.",
		'Jamie: I love how this whole thing makes everything more tender.',
		'Alex: Agreed. Even with the mood swings and exhaustion.',
		'Jamie: Oh yeah. I cried over a cereal commercial yesterday.',
		'Alex: Relatable. Hormones are no joke.',
		"Jamie: I keep wondering what the baby's personality will be like.",
		"Alex: I hope they're chill. Or at least a good sleeper!",
		'Jamie: Amen to that!',
		'Alex: Have you been reading any baby books?',
		"Jamie: A few. But mostly following my body's lead for now.",
		'Alex: Wise approach. Too much info can get stressful.',
		'Jamie: Yep. One day at a time.',
		'Alex: You nesting yet?',
		'Jamie: A little. I cleaned out an entire closet yesterday.',
		"Alex: Haha same! Something just kicked in and I couldn't stop organizing.",
		"Jamie: It's like some switch flips in your brain.",
		'Alex: Totally instinctual.',
		'Jamie: Do you ever just stop and thinkâ€”this is really happening?',
		'Alex: All the time. Still feels unreal.',
		"Jamie: We're gonna be parents soon. That's huge.",
		'Alex: I know! Sometimes I get hit with this wave of excitement and fear at the same time.',
		'Jamie: Yep, that combo feels very familiar.',
		"Alex: But we've got this.",
		'Jamie: We really do.',
		"Alex: Let's check in next weekâ€”see how 15 weeks is treating us?",
		'Jamie: Yes! Weekly bumpdates?',
		'Alex: You read my mind.',
		'Jamie: Chat soon, mama!',
		'Alex: Take care, mama. Talk soon!'
